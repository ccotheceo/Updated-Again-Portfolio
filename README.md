# Updated-Again-Portfolio

This is an updated portfolio page that is built using react. I have also included more repos into my portfolio. 

## Issues 
I am having difficulty with getting my footer to stay on the page. I have tried to but it just wont come back. It is hidden outside of the page but when i inspect it can be found. I am going to reach out for help.
